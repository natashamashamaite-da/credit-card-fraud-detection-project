Problem Statement: Credit card fraud poses significant financial and reputational risks to financial 
institutions and customers. 
Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and early is important to:

- Help minimise financial losses.

- Protect customers from unauthorised charges.

- Improve trust in digital payment systems. 

With this project, the goal was to build a predictive model taht can identify fraudulent transactions with
high reliability while minimizing false positives especially during the festive season. 

Dataset description:
- The dataset contains credit card transaction records, where each row represents a transaction.
- Target VariableL
  - 1 -> Fraudulent transaction
  - 0 - > Legit transaction

Features:
The dataset has transaction-related and customer-related features like:
- Transaction amount
- Customer income and spending behaviour

Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
Preprocessing  steps:
- Cleaning and standardising column names
- Checking for missing values
- Separating features and target variable
- Visualising the distribution of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions to understand class
imbalance.

Machine Learning Pipeline:
1. Train-Test Split:
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation on unseen data.

2. Models Implemented:
Logistic Regression: I used this as a baseline classification model and I chose it for:
- Interpretability
- Efficiency
- Suitability for binary classification problems
