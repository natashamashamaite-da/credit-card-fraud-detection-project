Model Evaluation:
Because this is a classification problem, performance is evaluated using 5 metrics that are
appropriate for imbalanced datasets.

Evaluation Metrics:

- Accuracy

- Precision

- Recall

- F1-score

- Confusion matrix

Recall helps to assess how well fraud is detected.

Precision helps to assess how many flagged transactions are actually fraudulent.

Possible real-world Applications:
The model could be used for:

- Credit card fraud detection systems.

-Financial risk management

- Transaction monitoring and alert systems.

Future Improvements:

1. I could address class imbalance using techniques such as:
-SMOTE

-Class weighting

2. Try advanced models like:
-Gradient Boosting

- XGBoost

3. Add cross-validation for improved reliability

4. Perform threshold tuning to optimise precision-recall trade-offs.
